###Playing with svg js libraries

- Now added a clickable demo. This was made using snapsvg (http://snapsvg.io). 

####Issue/things to address
- How to get the width and height dimensions of the svg element. It seems that this value cannot be determined until a graphic is placed inside the svg element. The reason I don't know this is probably because I'm using the library wrongly.
